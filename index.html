    <p><span>Dear Mom and Dad,</span>  
  I never quite understood what people meant when they say
   they think of those they miss every single day. How is that possible? However, you are in my thoughts every day,
   even in the simplest of ways. 
   I cannot thank you enough for all the support and love you have given me. I never would have made it here without you.  
  Thank you for everything</p>

<div class="para2">
  <p >I hope that I made you proud. I hope that you bring my love with you in heaven. I know you are in a place where there’s no pain. I know you are in a place where you are always happy and you do not have to worry on anything. I know we will meet again, but this doesn’t stop the heartache 
    I always feel and this doesn’t stop the tears from falling.</p>
